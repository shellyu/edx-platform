Models for Student Identity Verification

This is where we put any models relating to establishing the real-life identity
of a student over a period of time. Right now, the only models are the abstract
`PhotoVerification`, and its one concrete implementation
`SoftwareSecurePhotoVerification`. The hope is to keep as much of the
photo verification process as generic as possible.

class PhotoVerification(StatusModel):
    """
    Each PhotoVerification represents a Student's attempt to establish
    their identity by uploading a photo of themselves and a picture ID. An
    attempt actually has a number of fields that need to be filled out at
    different steps of the approval process. While it's useful as a Django Model
    for the querying facilities, **you should only edit a `PhotoVerification`
    object through the methods provided**. Initialize them with a user:

    attempt = PhotoVerification(user=user)

    We track this attempt through various states:

    `created`
        Initial creation and state we're in after uploading the images.
    `ready`
        The user has uploaded their images and checked that they can read the
        images. There's a separate state here because it may be the case that we
        don't actually submit this attempt for review until payment is made.
    `submitted`
        Submitted for review. The review may be done by a staff member or an
        external service. The user cannot make changes once in this state.
    `must_retry`
        We submitted this, but there was an error on submission (i.e. we did not
        get a 200 when we POSTed to Software Secure)
    `approved`
        An admin or an external service has confirmed that the user's photo and
        photo ID match up, and that the photo ID's name matches the user's.
    `denied`
        The request has been denied. See `error_msg` for details on why. An
        admin might later override this and change to `approved`, but the
        student cannot re-open this attempt -- they have to create another
        attempt and submit it instead.

    Because this Model inherits from StatusModel, we can also do things like::

        attempt.status == PhotoVerification.STATUS.created
        attempt.status == "created"
        pending_requests = PhotoVerification.submitted.all()

    Software Secure (http://www.softwaresecure.com/) is a remote proctoring
    service that also does identity verification. A student uses their webcam
    to upload two images: one of their face, one of a photo ID. Due to the
    sensitive nature of the data, the following security precautions are taken:

    1. The snapshot of their face is encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode. All
       face photos are encypted with the same key, and this key is known to
       both Software Secure and edx-platform.

    2. The snapshot of a user's photo ID is also encrypted using AES-256, but
       the key is randomly generated using pycrypto's Random. Every verification
       attempt has a new key. The AES key is then encrypted using a public key
       provided by Software Secure. We store only the RSA-encryped AES key.
       Since edx-platform does not have Software Secure's private RSA key, it
       means that we can no longer even read photo ID.
